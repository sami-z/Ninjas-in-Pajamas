# Ninjas-in-Pajamas (T03 - GROUP 12)

This is a form-based application designed to make student life easier. Our program consists of three features: a Club Opportunity Finder, a Financial Helper, and a GPA Calculator. As of the second version completed for Demo 2, all three features are implemented as text-based programs, and the GUI of the main menu and GPA Calculator is functional. The calculator takes information about the students' grades and weightings and computes minimum grades required for future assessments/courses to achieve a specified goal.

Version 2 can be located in the master branch of the repository under the "main" folder. From there, the "src" folder contains the code for our project, which is organized into five main packages. In "GUI_PACKAGE" you can find the Main.java file, which should be run in order to use the program.

How to Compile and Run:
1. Click "Clone or download" in the GitHub repository (Ninjas-in-Pajamas) and download the repository as a zip file.
2. Unzip/Extract all the packages/files into the desired directory.
3. Create a new JAVA project in Eclipse.
4. Import the unzipped packages/files into your newly created JAVA project (in the src folder).
5. Import the map.txt and data.txt files into the PROJECT (NOT the src folder).
6. Run Main.java only and follow the instructions to go through the first GUI version of the application.
