# Ninjas-in-Pajamas (T03 - GROUP 12)

This is a form-based application designed to make student life easier. Our program consists of three features: a club/volunteer opportunity finder, a GPA calculator, and a financial planner. As of the first version, only the club opportunity finder is useable, and it works as a text-based program. It takes information as input from the user, such as their year of study, current faculty, and interests/hobbies, then creates a list of recommended clubs tailored to their specifications. The user has the opportunity to learn more about each club.

Version 1 can be located in the master branch of the repository under the Main Folder. The src Folder contains the seven current classes that the program uses. 

How to Compile and Run:
1. Click "Clone or download" in the GitHub repository (Ninjas-in-Pajamas) and download the repository as a zip file.
2. Unzip/Extract all the files into the desired directory.
3. Create a new JAVA project in Eclipse.
4. Import the unzipped JAVA files into your newly created JAVA project (in the src folder).
5. Import the map.txt and data.txt files into the PROJECT (NOT the src folder).
6. Run main.java only and follow the instructions to go through a text-based version of the application.
