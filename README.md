# Ninjas-in-Pajamas (T03 - GROUP 12)

This is a form-based application designed to make student life easier. Our program consists of three features: a club/volunteer opportunity finder, a GPA calculator, and a financial planner. As of the first version, only the club opportunity finder is useable, and it works as a text-based program. It takes information as input from the user, such as their year of study, current faculty, and interests/hobbies, then creates a list of recommended clubs tailored to their specifications. The user has the opportunity to learn more about each club.

Version 1 can be located in the master branch of the repository under the Main Folder. The src Folder contains the seven current classes that the program uses. 

How to Compile and Run:
