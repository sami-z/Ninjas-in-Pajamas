One thing we all have in common is a passion for improving mental health. Man-Up has three main objectives, 1. Remove gender as a barrier when reaching out to support: People of all genders face struggles and concerns in regards to their mental health. We also know that it can be especially more challenging for men to ask for help when they need, so we are working to create a campus without stigma or barriers so everyone can achieve their own mental wellness. We want to re-define the phrase "Man Up" such that manning up does not simply mean trying to hide and ignore their feelings; rather, to have the courage to connect with others in times of need. 2.Promote Safer Drinking: We know that drinking can be a big part of socializing in university and for some, alcohol might be a way of coping with poor or declining mental health. We want to talk about drinking in a way that doesnít result in harm to yourself or those around you. We are NOT about stopping drinking, itís all about harm reduction. 3. Connecting Students: University can be overwhelming and between classes, work, and worrying about your future, you might feel pretty alone. We are here to tell you that YOU ARE NOT ALONE! We want a campus where people can connect to those around them and we are trying to create those circumstances.

Organ_Transplant_Organization|One organ donor can save 8 lives and one tissue donor can enhance the lives of 75 individuals. However, Alberta has one of the lowest rates of organ and tissue donation in the country. The Saving Lives Via Transplants (SLVT) club at the University of Calgary group shall work towards increasing the awareness of students at the University of Calgary of the need for organ and tissue donors. Furthermore, this group will provide educational opportunities to students regarding the registration and donation process. Of particular importance is an understanding that the circumstances under which one may become a potential organ or tissue donor are quite often sudden, unexpected, and tragic. While surveys show a majority of individuals support organ and tissue donation, many do not discuss these intentions and decisions are left to grieving family members. Fortunately, with the passing of the ìHuman Tissue and Organ Donation Amendment Actî by the Alberta legislature in 2013 a provincial organ and tissue donation registry was established. This registry enables individuals with intentions of being organ or tissue donors to register their intent to donate. Registering oneís intent to donate organs or tissue is a means of providing consent for this crucial decision-making process. Therefore, in addition to providing educational opportunities for students at the University of Calgary regarding the lifesaving possibilities of organ and tissue donation, this group will help facilitate registration in the provincial registry for those students who are eligible. Specifically, the group shall operate for the purpose of: 1. Raise the awareness of students at the University of Calgary about the dire need for tissue and organ donors in Alberta, and raise awareness of the provincial registry. 2. Encourage University of Calgary students to have ìDeclaration of Intentî discussions with their friends and family. 3. Encourage eligible members of the University of Calgary student body to register their intent to donate in the Alberta registry. 4. Serve as a prototype to be adopted by student groups at other Universities in Alberta. 5. Encourage provincial legislators to continue to support Bill 207, the ìHuman Tissue and Organ Donation Amendment Actî. 6. Coordinate with off campus groups in situations which will benefit this group towards its mission and objectives. Such groups include but are not limited to the Alberta Donates Life Coalition (ADLC), Organ Tissue Donation Awareness (OTDA), the Tissue and Organ Donation Awareness Committee (TODAC), the Alberta Transplant Institute (ATI), Organ Tissue Donation Awareness (OTDA), Alberta Health Services and the Canadian Transplant Association (CTA).
